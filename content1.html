    <h4>Basic of Cement</h4>
    <p>
        Cement comes from limestone. Limestone is a soft, light-colored rock with a grainy texture. The key ingredient in limestone is calcium. Limestone is a sedimentary rock typically formed from crushed seashells. (Chalk is also a form of limestone, calcium is basically “chalk-element”)

    <h4>How to make Cement</h4>
    <p>
        Firstly you crush the limestone into powder then you burn it to turn calcium carbonate (CaCO3) into calcium oxide (CaO). Calcium oxide is caustic powder, traditionally known as “quicklime” (“quick” means “active, alive”). When quicklime is combined with water. The water does cool it and it also reacts with the water and give off heat. The result is Ca(OH)2, Calcium hydroxide, aka “slaked” or “hydrated” lime
    </p>

    <p>
        If you then pour slaked lime into a mold. It will absorb CO2 from the air and turn back to CaCO3 (and give off water vapor) In other words, when cement sets it turns back into limestone
    </p>

    <p>
        Basically we crush and burn rock, and then re-constitute it at a time and place in a form we choose 
    </p>

    <h4>Mixture of Cement</h4>
    <p>
        Now a pure lime mixture like this isnt very useful. To use in construction, you need to mix it with something to give volume and strength
        <ul>
            <li>Add sand, it becomes mortar (brick)</li>
            <li>Add sand and gravel, it becomes concrete</li>
        </ul>
        (sand and gravel in this context is called aggregate)
    </p>

    <p>
        Those are basics, but there are many advanced formulas for cement
        One problem is that cement is strong under compression but not tensile
    </p>

    <p>
        During industrial revolution, we figured out how to reinforce concrete with iron bars
These reinforcing bars, or “rebar” give concrete tensile strength
